Retail Data Sales Analysis


# ![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)


## Dataset Content
I will be using a dataset from kaggle which is linked below. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset/data



## Hypothesis and how to validate?
My hypothesis is how are the markdown promotions impacting the weekly sales? I will model the effects of the markdowns between 2010-2012, and provide recommended actions based on insights drawn and how to improve the retail sales. I will be validating this by cleaning the datasets, merging them and analysing them to prove my hypothesis right and to take further action to support this data. 

## Project Plan
First, I downloaded and applied the dataset from kaggle into jupyter notebook, I then began checking each dataset for any cluttered, missing data. Once I found if there was any missing data, I then filled this in using the mean and created an additional dataset called 'cleaned_features' dataset. I began basic visualisation in order to meet my objectives and analysed my findings. I used more advanced visualisation such as Plotly to get more insight into the data, specfically when were the promotional markdowns the most effective. Once I found my findings, I wrote in detail about them underneath and then gave a conclusion and next steps, if this project was either to be recreated or to be continued.
The data was collected fine, and the processing was not time consuming at all. With the missing values in one of the datasets, I chose to fill the missing values. The data was managed fine when analsying the findings and interpretating the graphs.


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?



## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* I used Pandas, Numpy, Madplotlib, Seaborn; and I used these libraries to complete this project by being able to plot data into graphs, calculate information and fill in missing values, and I also used Pandas for data manipulation so that the data was easier to interpret.
